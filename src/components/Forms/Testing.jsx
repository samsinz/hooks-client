      <h1>Sexual Health and Orgasms</h1>
      <p>
        Sexual health is an important aspect of overall physical and mental wellbeing. In this page,
        we will explore some facts and statistics about orgasms and their role in sexual health.
      </p>
      <h2>What is an orgasm?</h2>
      <p>
        An orgasm is a physical and emotional sensation that typically occurs during sexual activity.
        It is often accompanied by muscular contractions and a feeling of intense pleasure.
      </p>
      <h2>How common are orgasms?</h2>
      <p>
        According to a study of over 52,000 adults, 95% of men reported usually or always reaching
        orgasm during sexual activity, while only 65% of women reported the same.
      </p>
      <h2>Can everyone experience an orgasm?</h2>
      <p>
        While most people are capable of experiencing an orgasm, there are some individuals who may
        have difficulty reaching orgasm or may not be able to experience one at all. This can be due
        to a variety of factors, such as physical or psychological conditions, medications, or other
        health issues.
      </p>
      <h2>How can orgasms improve sexual health?</h2>
      <p>
        Orgasms can have numerous benefits for sexual health, both physical and mental. Some of
        these benefits include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced stress and anxiety</li>
        <li>Improved mood and sense of wellbeing</li>
        <li>Increased intimacy and connection with a partner</li>
        <li>Improved sleep and relaxation</li>
        <li>Increased blood flow and muscular relaxation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition to these benefits, orgasms can also serve as a form of exercise, as they can
        cause the heart rate and blood pressure to increase and can help to strengthen the pelvic
        floor muscles.
